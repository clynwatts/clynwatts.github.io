I am a hydrologist and PhD candidate at UMass Amherst, and a reasearcher with Living Observatory . I study the role groundwater plays in freshwater wetland restorations in former cranberry bogs in southeastern Massachsuetts. We are answering questions around how water moves through these wetlands, and how flowpaths change in response to restoration and changing climate. I use a wide variety of tools to answer these questions, including isotope geochemistry, fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing, and thermal drone mapping.
Broadly, my interestes include: wetland hydrology, flood hazard mitigation, temperature as a groundwater tracer, drones as geoscience tool. Always, I seek projects that are community driven or address a community need.
