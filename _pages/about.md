I am a hydrologist and PhD candidate at UMass Amherst, and a reasearcher with [Living Observatory](https://projects.livingobservatory.org/people/lwatts) . I study the role groundwater plays in freshwater wetland restorations in former cranberry bogs in southeastern Massachsuetts. We are answering questions around how water moves through these wetlands, and how flowpaths change  in response to restoration and changing climate. I use a wide variety of tools to answer these questions, including isotope geochemistry, fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing, and thermal drone mapping. 

Broadly, my interestes include: surfacewater - groundwater interactions, temperature as a groundwater tracer, drones as tools in hydrology and goemorphology, land use history of kettle hole peatlands. 


My background
======
I am originally from Central New York and grew up exploring the forests and water bodies of the Finger Lakes and Adirondacks. I studied geology at Smith College, where I first got interested in sediment transport and heavy metal contamination. I sparked my interest in teaching working as an environmental educator both outdoors and in the classroom at an education organization based in New York City.
