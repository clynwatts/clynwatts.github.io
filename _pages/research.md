I study the role groundwater plays in freshwater wetland restorations in former cranberry bogs in southeastern Massachusetts. In conjunction with collaborators at [Living Observatory](https://projects.livingobservatory.org/people/lwatts), we are answering questions around environmental restoration impacts these sites. I investigate how water moves through these wetlands, and how flowpaths change in response to restoration and changing climate. I use a wide variety of tools to answer these questions, including isotope geochemistry, fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing, and thermal drone mapping. Broadly, my interests include: wetland hydrology, flood hazard mitigation, temperature as a groundwater tracer, drones as geoscience tools. Always, I seek projects that are community driven or address a community need.
