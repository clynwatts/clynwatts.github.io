This past week, we led a field campaign to collect samples and data at Foothills Preserve. We spent two days at Foothills Preserve measuring water levels, collecting water level and temperature data from data loggers, measuring stream discharge, installing seepage meters, and installing seepage meters. The water level in one of the ponds was lower than it was at the beginning of May, but there is still plenty of water on site!
